# C-Keylogger
A keylogger made using C++ of windows.

For now, it is more of a proof of concept, but it works.

The program output will be captured only if you mkdir in "../output/Keys.txt"
or you can change the code yourself.

# Features (for now):
- Logs keystrokes to keys.txt
- Uses windows API LowLevelKeyboardProc to capture keystrokes

# TODO:
- Send the keystrokes to a remote server
- Make a separate server to see the keystrokes in a gui
- Make it stealthy
- Make the keystrokes more understandable
- Send the window application name being used to the server
- Encrypted communication with the server
- Think more ideas
