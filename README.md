# C++ Keylogger
A keylogger made using C++ of windows.

For now, it is more of a proof of concept, but it works.

The program output will be captured only if you mkdir in "../output/Keys.txt"
or you can change the code yourself.

<b>I recommend you don't use this program for now, as it is not ready but you can keep a track of this for the end result</br>
<b>But I am proud to say that, the program didn't get detected for now by the antivirus for storing the keystrokes</b>

# Currently what I am working on for this project:
- Learning winsock2.h for networking in C++
- Learn to hide the console window and disguise the program as legit
- Making rootkits in linux to hide the program itself (probably after few months)

# Features (for now):
- Logs keystrokes to keys.txt
- Uses windows API LowLevelKeyboardProc to capture keystrokes

# TODO:
- Send the keystrokes to a remote server
- Make a separate server to see the keystrokes in a gui
- Make it stealthy
- Make the keystrokes more understandable
- Send the window application name being used to the server
- Encrypted communication with the server
- Think more ideas
